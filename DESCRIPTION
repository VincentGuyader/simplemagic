Description: 'MIME' types are shorthand descriptors for file contents and can be
    determined from "magic" bytes in file headers, file contents or intuited from
    file extensions. Tools are provided to perform limited "magic" tests as well
    as mapping 'MIME' types from a database of over 1,500 extension mappings.
